Python Script which gets lists of objects around R from a given coordinate (RA,DEC), and finds brightest objects in the K band or in the rp filter. 
Performs this for a list of objects with (name, ra, dec). By default, performs it for the black_holes file: the list of dynamically confirmed black holes 
from https://www.astro.puc.cl/BlackCAT/transients.php. The script also scrapes this data.
